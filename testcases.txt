TESTCASES

Test 1: Create a file with 4 documents, commit & push after each addition, test
rollback and history, then destroy the project.

  ./WTF create p1
  ./WTF add p1 test1.txt
  ./WTF commit p1
  ./WTF push p1

  This sequence successfully creates a directory on the server and client. 'add'
  successfully adds the file to the manifest, 'commit' successfully adds the new
  file to the pending commits on the client and server. 'push' successfully
  sends the files listed in the pending commits to the server.

  ./WTF create p1
  ./WTF add p1 test2.txt
  ./WTF commit p1
  ./WTF push p1

  ./WTF create p1
  ./WTF add p1 test3.txt
  ./WTF commit p1
  ./WTF push p1

  ./WTF create p1
  ./WTF add p1 test4.txt
  ./WTF commit p1
  ./WTF push p1

  The server and client are both up to date and have 4 files in them, to test
  the 'history' command:

  ./WTF history p1 /*Prints the following on the client side*/

  History:
  1
  2
  upload	1	./p1/test1.txt	8a63191cd06427fd6dfa4684080a5a5d40ae536c

  upload	1	./p1/test2.txt	0c6737cee25d5bb06f443e2e7daf229d78ad6b12

  5
  upload	1	./p1/test4.txt	04d32ae2bfd48fbf5d1f7d75411a9a2f8f617e49

  Testing rollback:

  ./WTF rollback p1 10 //prints error on the client side due invalid version
  ./WTF rollback p1 0  //prints error on the client side due invalid version
  ./WTF rollback p1 5  //prints error on the client side due invalid version

  ./WTF rollback p1 3  //rolls back to version 3 successfully

  Testing history after rollback:

  ./WTF history p1

  /*The following is printed on the server side*/
  History:

  Testing Destroy:

  ./WTF destroy p1 //Project is successfully destroyed on the server

  /*Following is printed on the client side*/
  
  Status:project succesfully destroyed on server
